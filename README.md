<h1>Get started with training:

<p>Run the following command:</p>

```command
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<h2>Then we can try to run the training.py</h2>

<p>Run the following command:</p>

```command
py train.py
```

<h1>If this doesn't work then good luck! Don't forget that internet will always be your friend! :)</h1>


<p>Little side note: The second_server.py is an alternative flask app that works. If you want to use it you have to change the absolute path in the file. I know this is a bad practice but i tried using a relative path but doesn't seem to work with "WebApp/uploaded_file" and "WebApp/segmented_file"</p>
